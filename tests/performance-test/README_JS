2. start a provider:
   npm run-script startprovider --performance-test:domain=<DOMAIN>
3. start the javascript consumer test
   npm run-script jsconsumertest --performance-test:domain=<DOMAIN> [--performance-test:runs=<TIMES>]

In order to run the short-circuit-test:
    npm run-script jsconsumertest --performance-test:domain=<DOMAIN> --performance-test:viacc=FALSE [--performance-test:runs=<TIMES>]
