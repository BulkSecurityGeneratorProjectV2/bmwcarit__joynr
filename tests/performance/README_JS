The following instruction helps you in getting the performance test running

mvn install
npm install -g npm@latest
npm install

Then run the node applications by doing the following:

1. ensure a cluster controller allowing to be connected via web socket is running and accessible
2. start a provider
   npm run-script startprovider --performance-test:domain=<DOMAIN>
3. start the javascript consumer test
   npm run-script startjasmine --performance-test:domain=<DOMAIN> [--peformance-test:times=<TIMES>] [--performance-test:viacc=<on|off>]

Steps 1 and 2 are only required, if the parameter --performance-test:viacc is set to on for the 3. step
