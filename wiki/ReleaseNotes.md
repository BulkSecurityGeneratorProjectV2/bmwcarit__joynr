#joynr 0.9.0

##API relevant changes
* **[Java, C++]** The provider class hierarchy has been simplified. A class diagram is at
docs/diagram/ClassDiagram-JavaProvider.png. To implement a provider from scratch, extend
<Interface>AbstractProvider. To implement a provider based on the default implementation extend
Default<Interface>Provider
* **[C++]** Qt-related datatypes have been removed from the API, both in generated classes and in
runtime classes used for proxy creation, provider registration etc. Std types are now used instead.
* **[C++]** Future no longer accepts a callback as well; in order to sychronously retrieve values
from the future, call Future::getValues.
* **[C++]** getProxyBuilder() has been renamed createProxyBuilder()
* **[C++]** ProxyBuilder::RuntimeQos has been renamed to MessagingQos (as in Java)
* **[C++]** setProxyQos() has been removed from the ProxyBuilder. Messaging timeouts are set using
the MessagingQos, while qos attributes related to discovery are set in setDiscoveryQos()
* **[Java]** Access control has been activated, meaning that all Java-based providers will not be
accessible unless the request message passes an access control check. As development of access
control is ongoing (there is not yet official support for entering access control information in the
global access control directory), currently providers can be made accessible by using a
statically-injected access control property. The MyRadioProviderApplication class in
examples/radio-app provides an example of how this can be done.
* **[Java, C++]** registerCapability has been renamed registerProvider and no longer takes an "auth
token", which was a placeholder that is no longer needed.
* **[Java, C++]** Providers may now only be implemented using the asynchronous interface. The
sychronous provider API has been removed. Providers return by calling onSuccess callback function
*  **[Java, C++]** Franca's multiple output parameters are now supported.
*  **[Build]** Added Dockerfiles for building Java and C++ builds, with included scripts. These
scripts are also used by the joynr project itself in its own CI (Jenkins-based) environment.
* **[Java]** Capability Directory entries on the global directory are now persisted using JPA.

#joynr 0.8.0
#
##API relevant changes
* **[Java, C++]** Support of broadcast: it is now possible to subscribe to broadcasts on proxy side.
  Providers are able to fire broadcast events, which are then forwarded to subscribed proxies. See
  the [Broadcast Tutorial](Broadcast-Tutorial.md) for more information.
* **[Java, C++]** Support to stop/update an existing subscription: the creation of a new
  subscription returns a unique subscription ID. Supplying this id to the proxy API allows to stop
  or update an existing subscription.
* **[Java, C++]** Generate proxy API according to modifier flags in Franca model: only generate
  setters/getters/subscribeTo methods on proxy side, if respective flags are defined in the Franca
  model (e.g. readOnly implies no setters)
* **[Java, C++]** Names defined in Franca are taken 1:1 into code: the joynr generator framework
  reuses the upper and lower case as defined in the Franca model where possible
* **[Java]** Add copy constructor to complex types of Franca model: for each complex data structure
  in the Franca model, a copy constructor is created in the respective Java class
* **[Java, C++]** Rename subscription listener methods
  * onReceive: Gets called on every received publication
  * onError: Gets called on every error that is detected on the subscription

##Other changes
* **[Tooling]** Enable cleanup capability of joynr generator framework: it is now possible to
  trigger the joynr generator with the "clean" goal, meaning that previously generated files are
  deleted
* **[Tooling]** Create standalone joynr generator: joynr provides now a standalone joynr generator,
  which can be used independent of maven as build environment
* **[Tooling]** The joynr generator framework migrates to xtend 2.7.2
* **[Tooling]** Update Java version from 1.6 to 1.7
* **[Java, C++]** Added ability to radio-app example to apply geocast broadcast filters: the example
  shows how broadcasts can be used to implement a geocast
* **[C++]** Update to CommonAPI version 2.1.4
* **[C++]** C++ cluster controller offers WebSocket messaging interface: the C++ cluster controller
  provides now a WebSocket API to be accessed by joynr applications. The C++ libjoynr version
  supports WebSocket communication with the cluster controller
* **[C++]** Implement message queue: in case the destination address of the joynr message cannot be
  resolved, the message router is now able to queue messages for later delivery
* **[Android]**	Now supporting platform version 19.
* **[Android]**	AsyncTask from the Android SDK went from being executed in parallel in API 10, to
  sequential handling in later Android versions. Since there is no clean way to support the old
  and new semantics without wrapping the class, we are now bumping up support API 19. Prior versions
  are no longer supported.

#joynr 0.7.0
##API relevant changes
* **[Java]** SubscriptionListener is now called AttributeSubscriptionListener, and
  unregisterSubscription renamed unregisterAttributeSubcription (change required to differentiate
  from broadcasts)
* **[Java]** The hostPath property can now be set as joynr.servlet.hostPath.
* **[Java, C++]** SSL support for C++ and Java

##Other changes
* **[C++]** libjoynr and cluster-controller now communicate over a single DBus interface
* **[C++]** introduce MessageRouter on libjoynr and cluster-controller side to resolve next hop for
  messages
* **[C++]** remove EndpointAddress term and use simply Address
* **[Java]** use URL rewriting to implement load balancing on bounce proxy cluster
* **[Java]** enable bounce proxy controller to run in clustered mode
* **[Java]** refactor bounce proxy modules:
  * use Guice injection to configure servlets
  * use RESTful service adapters for messaging related components

#joynr 0.6.0
#
##API relevant changes
* **[Java]** exceptions: removed checked exceptions from ProxyBuilder
* **[Java]** Check for correct usage of SubscriptionQos
* **[Java]** ChannelUrlDirectoryImpl correctly implements unregisterChannelUrl
* **[Java]** Changes to GlobalCapabilitiesDirectory API causes this version to be incompatible with
  older server installations.
* **[C++]** joynr is now compatible with Qt 5.2
* **[C++]** read default messaging settings from file
  Default messaging settings are now read from file "resources/default-messaging.settings". When
  using the find_package command to resolve joynr, it will set the JOYNR_RESOURCES_DIR variable.
  You can copy the default resources to your bin dir using cmake's file command:

  ```bash
  file(
      COPY ${JOYNR_RESOURCES_DIR}
      DESTINATION ${CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}
  )
  ```

##Other changes
* **[C++]** cleaning up joynr libraries used in cmake find_package
* **[Java]** refactored messaging project structure for scalability-related components
* **[Java]** definition of RESTful service adapters for messaging related components
* **[Java]** implementation of lifecycle management and performance monitoring for controlled bounce
  proxy
* **[Java]** scalability extensions for channel setup at bounce proxy
* **[Java]** scalability extensions for messaging in non-exceptional situations
* **[Java]** backend: improved shutdown responsiveness
* **[Java]** discovery directory servlet: mvn commands to start for local testing
* **[Java]** logging: preparations to allow logging to logstash (distributed logging)
* **[Java]** binary archives (WAR format) of backend components are available on Maven Central
* **[Java]** Enable backend module "MessagingService" to work with joynr messages of unknown content
  type
* **[Java]** Joynr provides rudimentary embedded database capabilities
* **[Tooling]** Augment features of joynr C++ code generator
* **[Tooling]** Write common util for all generation templates to resolve names of methods, types,
  interaces, arguments, â€¦
