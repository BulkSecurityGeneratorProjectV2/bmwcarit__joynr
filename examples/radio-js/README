Prerequisite:

For both, consumer and provider, the joynr backend services (Discovery and Access Control) have to
be started first.

Run a MQTT broker (e.g. [Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org)) listening on port 1883 and deploy
discovery-directory-jee and domain-access-controller-jee to a Java EE application server
(e.g. Payara):
asadmin deploy <RADIO_HOME>/target/discovery-jee.war
asadmin deploy <RADIO_HOME>/target/accesscontrol-jee.war

See Radio App Tutorial or Infrastructure Guide for the configuration of Payara.

To try out the Radio example run:

	mvn clean package jetty:run-war

Then open the following URLs in two separate browser windows:

http://localhost:8080/provider.html
http://localhost:8080/consumer.html
