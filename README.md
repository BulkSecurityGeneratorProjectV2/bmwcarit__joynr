# Overview
joynr is a web-based communication framework for applications wanting to interact with other
applications, no matter whether they're deployed on consumer devices, vehicles, or backend
infrastructure.

joynr makes writing distributed applications easy, as it:

* takes care of determining the most appropriate communication paradigm to talk with the desired
  end point
* provides a simple application programming interface to the joynr framework
* speeds up integration of new applications

... allowing you to focus on building your distributed application.
