# What is joynr?
joynr is a web-based communication framework for Java, C++, and JavaScript applications
wanting to interact with other applications, no matter whether they're deployed on consumer
devices, vehicles, backend infrastructure or in the cloud.

joynr makes writing distributed applications easy, as it:

* takes care of determining the most appropriate communication paradigm to talk with the desired
	end point
* provides a simple application programming interface to the joynr framework
* speeds up integration of new applications

... allowing you to focus on building your distributed application.

# How do I write joynr?
joynr is correctly written as "joynr". It is not an abbreviation nor a combination of words.
